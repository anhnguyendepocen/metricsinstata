This is a short course showing you how to perform common methods applied econometrics in Stata. We will cover a set of methods including randomized experiments, instrumental variables and difference-in-difference strategies. 

The goal is to get you up and running with Stata as quickly as possible, streamlining content to the necessary components needed to start doing your own research in Stata.

The course is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with some background in Statistics / Econometrics. No coding experience is required. All datasets used are publicly available, so I would suggest running through each section, copying and running the code for yourself.

The course is divided into 10 guided tutorials, which are best done in sequence. Click on each section below to access the tutorial.

1. [Introduction to Stata](docs/part1/part1.html)
2. [Exploring and cleaning data](docs/part2/part2.html)
3. [Plotting data](docs/part3/part3.html)
4. [Randomized experiments and t-tests](docs/part4/part4.html)
5. [Regression](docs/part5/part5.html)
6. Matching
7. Instrumental Variables
8. Regression discontinuity designs
9. Difference-in-differences
10. Synthetic controls

Each tutorial was created using the excellent [Stata Markdown](https://data.princeton.edu/stata/markdown), developed by Germán Rodríguez.
